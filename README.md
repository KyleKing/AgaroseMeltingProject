# Meltable Agarose Bead Bed Project

The goal of this project was to demonstrate a bead bed (LMP Agarose beads) that can capture an analyte (via a sandwich immunoassay with silver enhancement) and using a change in temperature, be **melted for better optical detection**.

In this folder you will find all the code, notes, and resources to help you finish this project. I learned a great deal from electronics and software to microfluidics that I would have never learned in my classes. Feel free to email me any questions [kmking72@gmail.com](mailto:kmking72@gmail.com) or create a new issue at the [private Github repository](https://github.com/KyleKing/AgaroseMeltingProject/issues/new) - note: see login details below for how to access.

I've organized and condensed my notes as concisely as possible. I would start by looking through the posters `1_Posters` to get a general idea of the project.

## How to read `.md` files:

Download the [Markdown Preview Plus](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/markdown-preview-plus/febilkbfcbhebfnokafefeacimjdckgl) chrome extension. Go to the chrome extensions settings page (*chrome://extensions/*) and check the box to `Allow access to file URL's`. The last step is to go to the [Markdown Preview Plus Settings Panel](chrome-extension://febilkbfcbhebfnokafefeacimjdckgl/options.html) and change the default CSS to `github`.

### Alternatively

The entire folder is on Github under a private repository so you can more easily explore all of the files. You will need the login info for the shared Github account [UMD-MML](https://github.com/UMD-MML) (see the associated Mantis post).
