# PMMA Droplet Generator Devices

After some success with the PDMS devices, I explored alternatives using CNC-milled PMMA. This is a short summary of the considered designs and relative success of each. All videos are hosted on [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/uwgt93g2pvy5zed/AADoT59xlFzMaq7dk1BPQNjNa?dl=0) and on the Mantis post under `7_PMMA-Droplet-Generators`.

To see the device in actions see any of the three videos in the `videos` subfolder.
