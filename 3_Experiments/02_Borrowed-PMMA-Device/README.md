# Inherited PMMA Chip Test

Using chips left over from KJ's work, I setup a heated platform on a hot plate and collected the beads in an ice bath. The experiment went very well and proved very promising. After this success, I attempted to make the beads smaller and to produce greater quantities using PDMS devices.
