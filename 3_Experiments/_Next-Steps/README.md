# Next Steps

So far the droplet generator works relatively well. The challenge has been to load a bead bed with the agarose beads. I've taken a couple of different approaches and looked into filtering, pre-packing the beads (silica glass beads to *seed* the bead bed), or using wells instead of a bead bed, but ran out of time to pursue these options.

I would suggest looking through literature and determining how researchers use agarose beads in filtration columns and in other applications. Additionally, it may be worth considering a different hydrogel and re-approaching this problem from a materials perspective.
