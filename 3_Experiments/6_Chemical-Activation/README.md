# Chemical Activation

I did a pretty wide literature review and settled on two approaches. The first was a formaldehyde sensor, which I liked the simplicity, but when heated the reaction progresses so it just blackens and any optical improvement is obscured. The second approach using a hydrazide was far more effective. I made a proof of concept demonstration using bulk beads (~1 mm diameter).

## Agarose Formaldehyde Sensor (Tollens Reagent)

<p align="center">Then I setup to do a melting demonstration. Before the melt the beads were a light brown color</p>

<p align="center">However, after melting the color became a burnt black. The heat had driven the reaction to completion</p>

## Agarose Direct Assay / Sandwich Immunoassay

The agarose beads are incubated with sodium periodate, then a streptavidin-hydrazide complex, leaving two active streptavidin sites per monomer for biotin-avidin binding.

# Demonstration

I demonstrated the Hydrazide-activation assay using a direct assay (the exposed streptavidin on the agarose beads - biotion/gold). The visible rosy red color is from the gold nanoparticles. After heating there is an optical improvement and the color difference is visibly noticeable between the controls.
