## Heatsink Adapter

The Turtlebot was designed to be modular. The core component is the heatsink adapter, which has cutouts for the fan wires and bolt locations that allow for finer adjustment. When I left there were a handful printed around lab, so you shouldn't have to print anymore, but if you do there is an included .stl file ready to print.

## Chip Lock

A much less important piece, this one holds the microfluidic chip in place and allows for a lot of adjustability.

## Laser Cut Parts

There are three parts included in this folder. Make sure to see the instructions on laser cutting in [the parent folder's README.md file](https://github.com/KyleKing/AgaroseMeltingProject/tree/master/6_CAD%20Files#my-laser-cutting-process)
