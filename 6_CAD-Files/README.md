# CAD Files

Explore the sub-folders to see more about the included files. I exported several different formats and the included .stl file is ready to print.

## My 3D printing process:

- Design the part in Autodesk Fusion (Mac) and export a .stl file
- Open the .stl file in Autodesk Meshmixer (free and cross-platform)
- Rotate the 3D object to the best orientation, place on platform, and generate supports
    + You can generate supports in the Makerbot software, but they are difficult to remove. Meshmixer generates far superior supports
- You can submit the .stl file directly at http://ter.ps/3dprinters
    + (Not Recommended) If you print regularly, you can ask for the settings on their printers and submit the .makerbot file directly - which can have a slightly faster turnaround time

## My Laser Cutting Process:

- Start in Autodesk with a 3D model (which makes rounding corners far easier)
- Make a 2D drawing of the design and export as a PDF
- Crop the other lines on the drawing until you can only see the part (in preview on Mac)
- Open the cropped pdf file on a PC and print to 'Microsoft XPS'
    + This step generates a file that the Laser Cutter in the PIRLS lab can recognize. From here you will need to talk to Majid to complete laser cutter training and gain access. Training is only offered once a week and was on a Wednesday morning at like 8 am
