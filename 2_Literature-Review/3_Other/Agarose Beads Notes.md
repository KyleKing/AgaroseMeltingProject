## Paper: Fabrication of superporous agarose beads for protein adsorption: effect of CaCO3 granules content.

Materials: Agarose powder was obtained from Biowest (Shanghai, China). Polyoxyethylene sorbitanmonooleate (Tween 80) was purchased from Dengfeng Chemical (Tianjin, China). Sorbitan trioleate (Span 85) was purchased from China National Pharmaceutical Indus-
try (Beijing, China). Calcium carbonate (CaCO3) granules with an average particle size of 1.05?m and a density of 2.70g/mL were provided by Lihe (Tianjin, China). Metal oxide precursor, titanium(IV) tetraisopropoxide (TTIP, 99%), was purchased from Luchuan Chemical (Shandong, China). Diethylaminoethyl chloride (DEAE-Cl) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) were from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA). Other reagents were all of analytical grade and received

Technique:

- 47mL of distilled water plus 3g of agarose powder was heated to 95◦C to prepare an agarose suspension. Agarose concentration in the suspension was 6wt%
- Oil phase consisting of 100mL of cyclohexane, 3.8 g of Span 85 and 1.05 g of Tween 80 was prepared in 250-mL reactor and heated to 60◦C in water bath
- The well-mixed hot agarose suspension was poured into the oil phase under agitation at 1000 rpm. The stirring continued for 30 min, and then the emulsification was rapidly cooled down below 15◦C to solidify the
agarose beads
- The composite beads were collected and washed successively with petroleum ether, ethanol, and water. The beads were wet-screened on 100 mesh and 200 mesh standard sieves and the fraction between the two sieves, about 67%
of total, was collected for further use


## Paper: High-throughput generation of hydrogel microbeads with varying elasticity for cell encapsulation

Materials: Agarose with a gelling temperature in the range of 18e26 ?C (ultra-low gelling temperature agarose)was purchased from SeaPrep (Lonza, Switzerland, www.lonza. com). Phosphate buffer solution (1 wt.%) was purchased from Gibco-BRL (Rockville, MD). A non-ionic surfactant Span-80, mineral oil and glycerol were supplied by Aldridge-Sigma Canada. A 3 wt.% agarose solution was prepared by dissolving 1.5 g of agarose in 48.5 g of a 1 wt.% PBS solution under heating to 70 ?C, and subsequent cooling to room temperature. Agarose solutions with a concentration of 0.5 wt.% were prepared by dilution of the stock solution with a 1 wt.% PBS buffer solution. A non-ionic surfactant Span-80was dissolved to a concentration of 3 wt.% in mineral oil with a viscosity of 30 cPs (Gelest Inc., www.gelest.com).

Technique:

- Two agarose solutions with concentrations of 3.0 and 0.5 wt.% were supplied to the two inlets of the MF device using two independently controlled syringe pumps (Harvard Apparatus 33 Dual Syringe Pump, U.S.A.). Later in the text we refer to the solutions with agarose concentration of 3.0 and 0.5 wt.% as to Streams 1 and 2, respectively. Both solutions were heated to 37 ?C by placing the syringe pumps in an oven, however at the point of emulsification their temperature was reduced to 32 ? 1.0 ?C (verified by measuring the temperature with a thermo-couple). The total flow rate of Streams 1 and 2 was Qd ¼ 0.12 mL/h. The solutions were mixed in a serpentine channel with the length of 250 mm (Fig. 1). Thorough mixing of the solution in the wavy channel was verified by introducing a blue food dye in Stream 1 and monitoring the distribution of the dye in the mixed solution along the mixing channel. The concentration of agarose in the droplets was varied by tuning the ratio between the volumetric flow rates of the Streams 1 and 2. At the T-junction, the stream of the mixed agarose solution broke up and released droplets of the mixed agarose solution. The droplets travelled 250 mmin the downstream channel towards the outlet of
the MF device and then exited into an outlet tubing (HPFA tubing, Upchurch Scientific, U.S.A.). The outlet tubing was enclosed by a hose connected to a water circulator cooled to 2 ?C by a 1:4 vol. mixture glycerol and water. The droplets moved through the cooled tubing for approximately 5 min and were collected in a 15 mL conical tube filled with PBS solution. The tube was placed in an ice bath for 45 min to ensure complete gelation of the microgels. The resulting suspension was centrifuged at 1000 rpm at 4 ?C for 5 min, washed with a PBS buffer, and transferred into a PBS buffer.
